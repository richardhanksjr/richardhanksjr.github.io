                <p>Question: What is the difference
                    between ‘switch’ and
                    ‘if/else’? When would
                    you use one versus the
                    other?
                </p>


                <p>Answer: Switch and if/else
                    are both techniques that
                    can be used to select
                    a specific outcome based
                    on the an initial condition.
                    For example, if one wanted
                    the program to print
                    "polo" to the screen
                    when the user imputs
                    "marco", each of these
                    techniques could be used
                    to select the latter
                    when the input matches
                    the former. In general,
                    switch statements are
                    good for long lists of
                    potential conditions.
                    Because of the syntax,
                    it is somewhat easier
                    to right a long list
                    of switch statement conditions
                    than many if or if/else
                    statements. Additionally,
                    switch statements can
                    be helpful if there are
                    several conditions that
                    correspond to the same
                    output. In each of these
                    cases, an if/else statement
                    could be used, however.
                    If/else statements can
                    be a better choice in
                    situations where the
                    conditions are more complicated.
                    For example, if you wanted
                    to check multiple "and"
                    and "or" conditions within
                    a single boolean expression,
                    an if/else approach might
                    be easier to write. There
                    may also be a performance
                    advantage to using one
                    techniqe over another,
                    but that may be a case
                    by case consideration.</p>

                <p>Question: When would you
                    use ‘=’ vs ‘==’ vs ‘.equals’?
                    Explain what each of
                    these does and in which
                    cases you should use

                <p>Answer: In Java '=' refers
                    to assignment of a value
                    with a corresponding
                    variable, '==' refers
                    to to a boolean comparision,
                    and '.equals' is a method
                    for comparing the equivlanecy
                    of two strings. When
                    using '=', the prorgrammer
                    is telling the compiler
                    that the value to the
                    right of the '=' should
                    be assigned to the value
                    to the left. When using
                    '==', the programmer
                    is telling the compiler
                    that it should compare
                    the values to the right
                    and left of the '=='
                    and determine if they
                    are the same. If they
                    are, 'true' is returned
                    and, if not, 'false'
                    is returned. To compare
                    the values of two strings,
                    however you need to use
                    the '.equals()' method,
                    which returns 'true'
                    when the answer isn't
                    null and each of the
                    strings has exactly the
                    same content, otherwise
                    'false' is returned.

                <p>Question: To generate a random
                    number you use ‘Math.random()’.
                    What is ‘Math’? What
                    is the return type of
                    the ‘.random()’ method.
                    Why is the ‘M’ in ‘Math’
                    capitalized (you may
                    need to investigate Static
                    classes...hint hint).</p>


                <p>Answer: 'Math' in java is
                    a static class. Static
                    classes are classes defined
                    and nested within other
                    classes that can be referenced
                    without referencing the
                    outter class. Because
                    of this, a capital "M"
                    is used to identify this
                    feature of the class.
                    '.random()' is a method
                    of the "Math" class that
                    has a return type of
                    a double. Specifically,
                    it returns a double between
                    0.0 and, but not including,
                    1.0.

                <p>What does it mean to ‘cast
                    a double to an int’?
                    Give an example of when
                    you would do this and
                    explain what is happening.</p>


                <p>Answer: Casting a double
                    to and int means that
                    you change its type from
                    a double value to an
                    int value. In doing this,
                    everything to the right
                    of the decimal point
                    gets cut off, so it is
                    not like simply rounding
                    the value. One example
                    of when you might want
                    to do this is if you
                    are looking to add together
                    a double and an int.
                    In this example, a double
                    will be returned. If
                    one would actually like
                    to return an int, casting
                    the double to an int
                    would result in an int
                    being returned. In this
                    situation, the precision
                    of the double would be
                    lost in favor of having
                    the desired int value.</p>

                <p>Question: What is the difference
                    between a ‘for’, ‘while’
                    and ‘do while’ loop?
                    Give an example of when
                    you would use one versus
                    another. What is the
                    benefit of a ‘do while’
                    over a ‘while’?</p>


                <p>Answer: Each of these loops
                    has a different approach
                    to when and how to look
                    at the conditional statement.
                    In the case of a 'for'
                    loop, the program will
                    execute the block of
                    code following the 'for'
                    loop for the exact number
                    of times indicated within
                    the 'for' condition.
                    In the case of both the
                    'while' and the 'do while'
                    loops, the code will
                    execture for as long
                    as the condition returns
                    true. With each subsequent
                    pass through the code,
                    the condition is checked
                    again and, if it returns
                    true, the code will be
                    executed. The difference
                    between these two, though,
                    is that, in the case
                    of the 'do while' loop,
                    the code will be executed
                    one time before the condition
                    is checked the first
                    time. After the initial
                    execution of the code,
                    however, it performs
                    exactly as the 'while'
                    loop. The advantage of
                    the 'do while' loop is
                    that it allows the code
                    to run one time regardless
                    of whether the condition
                    returns true. If the
                    condition returns false
                    on first inspection,
                    the code will never run
                    and there are situations
                    where you want it to
                    run at least one time.</p>
