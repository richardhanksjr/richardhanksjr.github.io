					<p>The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in a U.S. district court in Pennsylvania, names not only accuser Andrea Constand as a defendant, but also her mother, two of Constand's lawyers, and American Media Inc., owner of the National Enquirer.

Cosby alleges that all five defendants violated a 2006 agreement that settled civil suits that Constand had filed against the comedian and American Media a year earlier.

Attorneys for Andrea Constand and Cosby gave CNN no comment.

Cosby was charged December 30 in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, with aggravated indecent assault against Constand, one in a long line of accusers and the first to go to authorities, in 2005.

The district attorney's office reopened the investigation based on "new evidence" that emerged after a judge ruled parts of his deposition in Constand's civil suit could be unsealed.

According to Cosby's testimony in the deposition, he admitted sexual contact with Constand, but said it was consensual.

In the suit filed Wednesday, Cosby claims that Constand and her attorney, Dolores Troiani, voluntarily cooperated with the Montgomery County District Attorney's criminal investigation into the decade-old sexual assault allegation.

The settlement "expressly prohibited" such cooperation, according to the lawsuit.

The suit also alleges that American Media Inc., which owns the National Enquirer, has continued to publish numerous stories about Constand's claims regarding Cosby "despite its clear contractual obligations to not publish any stories relating to certain allegations against Mr. Cosby." Cosby also claims Constand gave an interview to the National Enquirer that published in January 2016, another alleged violation of the settlement.

"Mr. Cosby has apparently decided his best legal defense is to sue one of his alleged victims and The National ENQUIRER, a publication that has been unflinching in its coverage of allegations against Mr. Cosby beginning in 2000 when everyone else avoided the story. We are confident that when the court reviews his claims against the ENQUIRER, it will find them to be without merit," said an AMI spokesperson.

Cosby is seeking repayment of money paid to settle the lawsuit.
